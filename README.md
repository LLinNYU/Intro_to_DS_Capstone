# Intro_to_DS_Capstone
This capstone project uses topics in the introduction to data science course to understand the factors that influence Spotify song popularity on 52000 songs.  
The python notebook is a smaller part of a larger collaborative project and includes some results from previous coding labs.  
The tasks involve data analysis to evaluate linear regression models and principal component analysis with the Kaiser criterion to determine whether the genres correspond to the number of clusters in the data.
